### Wireframes

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will use the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for game logic,
- `CSS` for effects rendering,
- `Browserify` to bundle js files.

This project will contain the following two scripts to handle the functionality of the game:

`game.js`: this script will handle the logic for visual elements and rendering them to the DOM.

`rhythm.js`: this script will handle the logic behind the scenes for playing the songs and tracking the score.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Setup all necessary Node modules and webpack. Write an entry file and render something basic on the screen.

**Day 2**: Create functionality for starting and pausing song as well as keeping track of score.

**Day 3**: Css styling and animations.
